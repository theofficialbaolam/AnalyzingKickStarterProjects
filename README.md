# AnalyzingKickStarterProjects

We analyze a dataset of approximately 321,000 KickStarter projects to answer questions such as 
  ●	From the data, which type of products are most likely to raise money?
  ●	Which type of products require the most amount of money to be successful?
  ●	What percentage of products that exceed the amount pledged actually succeed in releasing their product?
  ●	Which type of products are most likely to fail after raising money? Which type of products are most likely to not meet the required amount?
  ●	Is there a relationship between the number of backers and the amount raised?
  ●	Does the country of origin play a role in whether or not the product succeeds?
  ●	Does a greater amount needed to be raised play a part in determining whether or not the product raises enough money?
  ●	Is a more niche product less likely to raise money than one in a more popular category?
